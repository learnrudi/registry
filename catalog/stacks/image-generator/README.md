# Image Generator

Multi-provider image generation for RUDI content workflows. The stack exposes
one narrow MCP surface for agents:

- `generate_image` - generate one image with Gemini, OpenAI, or Replicate
- `compare_providers` - run the same prompt across multiple provider/model specs
- `list_models` - inspect active defaults, aliases, and reference support

See `READINESS_AUDIT.md` for the full schema, API, safety, and registry
readiness checklist. See `API_CONTRACT.md` for the MCP request, response, and
error contract.

## Install

```bash
rudi install image-generator
```

After setting or changing provider secrets, restart the RUDI router or sidecar
so the MCP process receives the updated environment.

## Providers

At least one provider key is required before generation:

```bash
rudi secrets set GEMINI_API_KEY "<key>"
rudi secrets set OPENAI_API_KEY "<key>"
rudi secrets set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN "<token>"
```

The default models are:

- Gemini sketch: `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview`
- Gemini photoreal: `gemini-3-pro-image-preview`
- OpenAI sketch/photoreal/edit: `gpt-image-2`
- Replicate sketch: `black-forest-labs/flux-schnell`
- Replicate photoreal: `black-forest-labs/flux-1.1-pro`
- Replicate edit: `black-forest-labs/flux-2-max`

Replicate is beta/model-specific in this stack. It remains available for
open-source hosted image workflows, but agents should prefer Gemini or OpenAI
unless the user asks for Replicate, open-source models, or a Replicate-specific
model. Use `list_models` to inspect Replicate aliases, reference-capable models,
and `release_status` before generation.

Older models remain available by passing an explicit `model` value, for example
`gpt-image-1.5`, or by setting the provider override environment variables.

Optional model override environment variables are supported for advanced users:
`GEMINI_MODEL_SKETCH`, `GEMINI_MODEL_PHOTOREAL`, `OPENAI_MODEL_SKETCH`,
`OPENAI_MODEL_PHOTOREAL`, `OPENAI_MODEL_EDIT`, `REPLICATE_MODEL_SKETCH`,
`REPLICATE_MODEL_PHOTOREAL`, and `REPLICATE_MODEL_EDIT`.

Live smoke baseline on 2026-05-17:

- Gemini `sketch` resolved to `gemini-3.1-flash-image-preview` and generated a square image.
- OpenAI `sketch` resolved to `gpt-image-2` and generated a 9:16 story image.
- Replicate is exposed as beta/model-specific until its aliases are live-smoked.

## Content Formats

Use the optional `format` field to request provider-native social asset shapes:

- `square` - 1:1 feed image
- `portrait` - 2:3 vertical feed image
- `story` - 9:16 story or short-form vertical image
- `landscape` - 3:2 landscape preview or thumbnail image

OpenAI `story` output is supported with `gpt-image-2`. Older OpenAI image
models return `unsupported_combo` for `format: "story"`; use Gemini, Replicate,
or OpenAI `portrait` for those legacy model calls.

## Safety Contract

Prompts are literal strings. The stack does not read prompt files.

Reference images must be local PNG, JPEG, or WebP files under 50 MB. Output
paths must be inside `~/.rudi/outputs`, and existing files are not overwritten.

## Outputs and Handoffs

`generate_image` returns the exact `out_path` written under `~/.rudi/outputs`.
When `out_path` is omitted, the stack creates a filename like
`image-<timestamp>-<nonce>.<detected-format>`.

`compare_providers` returns `gallery_path`, `out_dir`, and per-provider result
entries. The gallery is for human review; downstream stacks should use the
returned image file paths and metadata rather than guessing filenames.

Returned metadata includes `provider`, resolved `model`, `asset_format`,
`aspect_ratio`, byte count, detected `image_format`, and elapsed milliseconds.

## Examples

Generate with the default OpenAI model:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "prompt": "A clean square product image for a post about launching a local AI content suite. Modern desk, laptop, generated image thumbnails, bright natural light.",
  "model": "photoreal",
  "format": "square"
}
```

Compare providers:

```json
{
  "prompt": "Editorial social graphic about planning a week of content. Bright workspace, image moodboard, clean brand-safe composition.",
  "format": "portrait",
  "specs": ["gemini:sketch", "openai:photoreal", "replicate:flux-2"]
}
```

Generate a story asset with Gemini:

```json
{
  "provider": "gemini",
  "prompt": "A vertical story image for a social post about turning one article into a week of content. Clean mobile-first composition with room for headline text.",
  "model": "photoreal",
  "format": "story"
}
```

Generate a landscape thumbnail with Replicate:

```json
{
  "provider": "replicate",
  "prompt": "A landscape thumbnail for a video about building a local AI content suite. Clear focal point, high contrast, no text.",
  "model": "flux-2",
  "format": "landscape"
}
```

Generate a blog-header style image:

```json
{
  "provider": "openai",
  "prompt": "A polished editorial image for a blog post about multi-provider AI image generation. Modern workspace, image grid, subtle brand-safe color.",
  "model": "photoreal",
  "format": "landscape"
}
```

Inspect configured models:

```json
{
  "provider": "gemini"
}
```

`list_models` also reports `secret_status.configured` for each provider without
making provider API calls.

## Troubleshooting

- `missing_secret`: set the provider key with `rudi secrets set ...` and restart
  the router or sidecar.
- `unsupported_combo`: call `list_models` and choose a model whose `references`
  capability matches the request.
- `validation`: check prompt length, local reference paths, output location, and
  the maximum of eight `compare_providers` specs.
- `provider_error` or `timeout`: the stack reached the provider but the provider
  call failed or exceeded 120 seconds.
