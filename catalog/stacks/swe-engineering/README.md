# SWE Engineering Stack

Portable RUDI stack for the SWE Operating Manual and agent debt scanning.

This package exists so another computer can install the engineering doctrine
without relying on a local source path. It vendors only the portable manual
documents and the debt scanner needed by agents.

## Tools

- `swe_manual_list`: list bundled SWE Operating Manual documents.
- `swe_manual_read`: read one bundled manual document by id or filename.
- `swe_manual_search`: search bundled manual documents for a phrase.
- `swe_debt_scan`: run the packaged JS/TS agent debt scanner against a local
  repository using allowlisted command arguments.

By default, the scanner resolves TypeScript from this stack package rather than
from the target repository. Set `SWE_DEBT_SCAN_ALLOW_TARGET_TYPESCRIPT=true`
only when you intentionally want to scan with the target repo's local TypeScript
package.

## Install

```bash
rudi install stack:swe-engineering --with-related-skills
rudi index --json
rudi integrate codex
```

Restart the agent after indexing so the tools and related skill are available.

The related skill `skill:swe-compliance-checklist` gives agents the workflow for
turning the manual into phase-gated implementation and verification plans.
