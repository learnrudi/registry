# Google Workspace RUDI Stack

RUDI MCP stack for Gmail, Google Drive, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google Calendar, and Google Tasks workflows.

This stack owns Google Workspace OAuth, account selection, and direct Workspace API calls. Other stacks should call this stack for Gmail or Drive access instead of handling Google OAuth themselves.

## Tools

- Account tools: `account_list`, `account_switch`, `account_current`
- Gmail tools: profile, ordered history/cursor reads, search, header-only contact discovery, get, send, draft, reply, forward, labels, archive, trash, batch operations, and attachments
- Sheets tools: read, write, append, create
- Docs tools: read, create, insert image
- Slides tools: get presentation, get slide, get thumbnail, raw batch update
- Drive tools: list, upload, create folder, move, download, make public, delete
- Calendar tools: bounded historical organizer/attendee discovery pages, list, create, quick add, delete
- Tasks tools: list task lists, list tasks, create, update, complete, delete

## Requirements

- Node.js 20+
- RUDI installed and integrated with your agent
- A Google Cloud OAuth client for the Google account or Workspace tenant
- Enabled Google APIs for the tools you plan to use: Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, and Tasks

## OAuth Credentials

The stack reads OAuth client credentials from the RUDI secret `GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS`.

`GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` may be either:

- the full `credentials.json` content from Google Cloud, or
- an absolute path to a local `credentials.json` file

The credentials JSON must contain either an `installed` or `web` OAuth client with `client_id` and `client_secret`.

Do not paste OAuth client secrets, refresh tokens, access tokens, or connection strings into agent messages, logs, docs, or committed files.

Do not copy credentials or tokens into `~/.rudi/stacks/google-workspace/`; installed stack source may be replaced during reinstall or update. Use `rudi secrets set GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS` for OAuth client credentials and let `rudi auth` write per-account tokens under RUDI state.

## RUDI Setup

Install and configure the stack:

```bash
rudi install stack:google-workspace
rudi secrets set GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
rudi auth google-workspace user@example.com
rudi index stack:google-workspace --json
rudi integrate codex
```

Restart or reload the agent after integration.

## OAuth Callback

The auth helper starts a local callback server and opens a browser.

Default callback:

```text
http://localhost:3456/callback
```

If that port is occupied, the helper tries the next free port through `3465`. Register the callback URI your OAuth client will use in Google Cloud. For web clients, add every fallback URI you expect to allow.

The account argument is an identity boundary, not just a local label. During consent, select the exact Google user passed to `rudi auth`. Before saving a token, the helper retrieves the authenticated Gmail profile and verifies that its primary email address matches the requested account. A mismatch is rejected without overwriting the account's existing token.

Each account must have its own real directory beneath the stack's `accounts` state directory. Account-directory symlinks and linked token files are rejected so one mailbox cannot redirect or share another mailbox's credentials.

The requested scopes are:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.modify`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.send`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/documents`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/presentations`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar`
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks`

## State

Tokens and account state are stored outside the installed stack:

```text
~/.rudi/state/stacks/google-workspace/
```

Per-account tokens live at:

```text
~/.rudi/state/stacks/google-workspace/accounts/<account-email>/token.json
```

State files are written with private file permissions where the filesystem supports POSIX modes. Legacy token/account files from older installed stack directories are migrated into this state directory when the stack starts.

## Agent Guidance

Use `account_current` before acting when account context matters. Use `account_switch` or pass the tool's account argument when working across multiple Google accounts.

For privacy-minimized relationship discovery, `calendar_discovery_page`
requires an exact `account`, exact `calendar_id`, inclusive `window_start`,
exclusive `window_end`, bounded page/observation sizes, and an optional
continuation token. It verifies the authenticated Gmail profile matches the
requested account and returns only the echoed scope/window plus ordered
organizer/attendee observations. Provider event IDs and recurrence IDs become
source/account/calendar-scoped SHA-256 keys; event titles, descriptions,
locations, URLs, response statuses, raw provider objects, and credentials never
cross the discovery boundary.

`gmail_send` resolves the authenticated Gmail profile and renders that primary mailbox as the RFC 2822 `From` header. It does not silently inherit a different default Send-As alias.

Gmail composition loads the saved signature for the actual sending address using
`users.settings.sendAs.get` (existing `gmail.modify` access suffices). New drafts,
updates, direct sends, replies, and forwards include it once before quoted content.
Missing, unreadable, image-only, or duplicate signatures block the operation.
Draft sends check the reviewed body without modifying it; update and review an
old unsigned draft before sending. A changed saved signature also requires a
new draft review. Sent messages are read back and report `signatureVerified`;
if verification fails, the response still reports the successful send and warns
against resending. Text-bearing signature comparison ignores HTML formatting;
this is a presence check, not pixel-level logo or link verification. Nested MIME
alternatives use one preferred body. A metadata-only draft update fails before
writing if the existing text body is unreadable, stored externally, or has multiple
independent authored MIME parts that cannot be safely rebuilt. Supply
an explicitly reviewed replacement body if replacing that content is intended.

Ask for explicit user confirmation before sending email, sending a draft, deleting messages, deleting Drive files, making Drive files public, creating/updating/deleting calendar events, applying Slides batch updates, or creating/updating/completing/deleting tasks, unless the user has already authorized that action.

### Editing an existing Calendar event

Use `calendar_get` with `account`, `calendar_id` (defaults to `primary`), and
`event_id` to inspect event details and its etag. `calendar_update` accepts the
same identity plus optional `summary`, `description`, `location`, `start`, `end`,
`time_zone`, and `etag`. It requires an explicit `send_updates` choice (`all`,
`externalOnly`, or `none`) and at least one changed field. Use the returned etag
to reject changes made since inspection. Notes/location can be cleared with an
empty string; omitted fields remain unchanged.

Time changes require both start and end as ISO timestamps with UTC offsets,
with end after start. An optional IANA time zone applies to both; otherwise
existing zones are preserved. Metadata edits support all-day events, but timed
conversion and recurring series edits are rejected. For one recurring instance,
pass that occurrence's ID. Attendees, conference links, attachments, reminders,
and other fields are preserved and cannot be edited through this tool.

The implementation reads the current event, uses a conditional patch with its
etag, and reads it back to verify the requested fields. Each provider call has
a 30-second timeout and mutations are not retried automatically. A concurrent
edit returns `conflict`. An uncertain patch failure returns
`update_not_verified`; an accepted patch with failed/mismatched read-back returns
`updated_unverified`. Both are MCP error results with `verified: false`; inspect
with `calendar_get` before retrying. Only matching read-back returns
`status: updated` and `verified: true`.

Provider contracts: [event patch semantics](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/v3/reference/events/patch)
and [conditional modification](https://developers.google.com/workspace/calendar/api/guides/version-resources).

If a tool reports that authentication is missing, run:

```bash
rudi auth google-workspace user@example.com
```

Then rebuild the router cache:

```bash
rudi index stack:google-workspace --json
```
